## The IDEA

Working for a long time in a group gets boring without some music and more boring when everytime the same person plays his same fucking music all the fucking time. So this is solution.

This app is basically a chat that takes the youtube link and ques it. The number of people that can join is limit less.


### Features

1. Ques video from the chatters and plays one by one
2. Parses youtube link from various sources, i.e. mobile, desktop, playlist etc.
3. It's fucking realtime


## To do:
1. Make the DJ end look better
2. Detect youtube link in a converstation and automatically que it
3. Integrate Alogrithm X, the DJ algorithm
4. Make an android app
5. Now playing song in the Chat
6. Put a mute key from any chat
